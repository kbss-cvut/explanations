# EXPLANATION TOOLKIT

For each application it is necessary to provide an appropriate implementation of the Test interface for black box
approaches. For the incremental ones the same applies for the IncrementalTest interface. Please find examples of usage
in the `cz.cvut.dlt.explanation.CSTreeExperiments` class.

For usage as library You need neither of these libraries : JGraph, JGraphaddons, JGraphT.

These are used just for visualization of some of the algorithms.
